<h2>Abstract</h2><p>
PRISM provides a vocabulary to describe information such as: which social media platform(s) data were collected from, when were the data collected, and the methods and tools used; how the collected data were prepared to support analysis; which analysis methods were applied, and results of the analysis. Alignment of the PRISM model with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">W3C PROV data model</a> facilitates sharing of such provenance descriptions, enabling greater transparency of research and policy making.
